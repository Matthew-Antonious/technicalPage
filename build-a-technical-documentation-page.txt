            " Once your pet has been cleaned it is time to dry! At this point most pups will help you out with a good shake so take cover. After a good shake use a towel or two to get the majority of the water off.  "
          </p>
          <p>" If your furry friend doesn't require any additional work you can let them air dry at this point. However in my professional experience that is rarely recommended. Most dog washes provide high powered dryers that make the drying process much faster and also help remove more loose fur. "

            <li>Don't point the dryer in their face or ears.</li>
            <li>If the dog doesn't like the dryer try covering their head with a towel so it's not as loud.</li>
            <li>Covering their head can also help if they try to bite the dryer</li>
